## Introduction

This project is aimed at developing a system that detects instances of violence in live streams and automatically alerts nearby police stations or law enforcement agencies. The system utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze video streams in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Violence Detection**: Analyzes live video streams to detect instances of violence.
- **Automatic Alerting**: Notifies nearby police stations or law enforcement agencies when violence is detected.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large-scale live streams with efficient processing.

## How it Works

1. **Live Stream Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors live video streams from various sources.
2. **Violence Detection**: Utilizes machine learning and computer vision algorithms to detect violence in the video streams.
3. **Alerting Mechanism**: When violence is detected, an automatic alert is triggered to notify nearby authorities.
4. **Response and Intervention**: Law enforcement agencies can respond promptly to the alerts and take necessary actions.
 ### Results
